		<h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span id='first_words'>Electrospection</span> is an interactive map that visualizes state-by-state electricity generation data.
		The first view represents the "green-ness" of the electricity generated in each state of the US.
		A state is scored based on the number of megawatt-hours of each type of energy it generates.
		Each type of power has its own score from -10 to 10 which multiplies the number of megawatt-hours generated; the total of these points evaluates to a final score.
		If the score is positive, the state is colored green; if negative: red.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span id='first_words'>Green-ness</span> is a somewhat subjective concept, as it requires evaluation of the myriad side-effects of electricity generation by a particular method.
		For example: hydroelectric power dams release practically no greenhouse gasses (hooray!) <i>but</i> dams can prevent migratory fish like salmon from reaching their spawning grounds (boo) <b>however</b> fish ladders can be built to allow salmon to migrate.
		Not all dams have fish ladders and not all dams block migrating salmon, further complicating the issue.
		So, it seems like kind of a wash, but greenhouse gas emissions are more important to me than ensuring the utmost preservation of the salmon lifecycle, so I put the slider at +1.
		Do some research about the individual facilities in your state and set the sliders to your beliefs!
		The map represents a rough concept of green-ness and values are changeable to your preference - play with the sliders below and see how the map changes.

		<span id='first_words'>The data</span> were pulled from the beta API of the <%= link_to "Energy Information Agency", "http://www.eia.gov" %> (it is an incredible resource, if you know how to look). Packages used to make this were <%= link_to "d3.js", "http://www.d3js.org" %>, <%= link_to "Bootstrap", "http://www.getbootstrap.com" %>, <%= link_to "jQuery", "http://www.jquery.com" %>, <%= link_to "jQuery UI", "http://www.jqueryui.com" %> and a neat little jQuery plugin called scrollTo.

			<h3>Show me more!</h3>
			<span id='first_words'>Click a state</span> to see its electricity generation history shown graphically.
			If you want to compare states (to see who generates more coal power, for example), use the "Compare States" button, click the states you want to compare, and then click "Make Chart."

			If you want to focus on certain power sources, click a corresponding element in any of the graphs and it will remain "hovered."

	<h3>Caveats</h3>
		<p>
			This map doesn't take electricity sold <i>between</i> states because that data is not readily available. Each state's color and graphs are made from data about
		</p>
		<p>
			TALK LATER about hydro_pumped energy. It's a compensatory measure states take to prevent using non-green power sources during peak hours HOWEVER it's often a net negative for states! Crazy.
		</p>
	<h3>Other Takeaways</h3>
		<p>
			Make more data available- that's the real definition of transparency.
			Stuff like this is awesome: http://www.codeforamerica.org/2013/07/25/epic-win-for-nycs-open-data-community-pluto-is-free/

	<h3>Further Education</h3>
		<p>
			stuff to ackowledge: http://www.theatlantic.com/special-report/users-guide-energy (can put that data on this map, too)
			http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/business/energy-environment/intermittent-nature-of-green-power-is-challenge-for-utilities.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hp&
			http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/2013/07/25/city-liberates-map-data-trove/ (pushing for more open data is great to learn about practices)
			person to reach out to: 

		</p>
	<h3>Where next?</h3>
		<p>
			I would for this to eventually be transformed into a vizualizer for all of the EIA's data (and data from other sources, too).
			It's possible to put energy consumption data in the map, though the graphs per-state would need to be a little more complicated to properly show how energy use breaks down per-use (transportation, electricity, heating, etc.).
